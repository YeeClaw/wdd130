                    Hello, my name is Austin Colt and I am a developer by trade and musician by hobby. 
                    That's not to say that I am more passionate about one or the other, but I do have 
                    a particular knack for both. Here on this portfolio you will find my skill sets for 
                    anything that I am proficient in. If you would like to reach me, please refer to 
                    the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.
                </p>

                    Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by computers and code. I learned how 
                    to program at a very young age (following in the footsteps of my father) and have 
                    been doing fun and exciting things ever since. While my specific qualification are 
                    listed in the <a href="programming.html">programming</a> section of this website, 
                    this is something that I have been doing for a long time and I'm quite proud of.

                    In the grand scheme of things, music has been a more recent adventure for me, but 
                    one that I have found to be quite fulfilling, and is something that has given me 
                    a unique perspective on the problems on life. I have experience playing in recitals,
                    gigs, and many other contexts across various different instruments. My full
                    experience is detailed on the <a href="music.html">music</a> page.
