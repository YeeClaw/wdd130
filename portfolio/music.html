                <p>
                    Music has brought profound changes to my life in many different forms. It has 
                    allowed me to think about problems with a unique perspective, and have given 
                    me a greater appreciation for living in the moment. Additionally, it has been
                    my best teacher for team work on just about any scale. Being able to work with 
                    a group of musicians is integral to any kind of performance.

                    Piano is my primary instrument of choice, and is what I have the most experience 
                    with. I can play mostly any genre and I'm great with working on the fly. I've 
                    played in jazz bands, and have even gigged with other pop/punk rock bands. Since 
                    I have started, I am trained both classically and with Jazz. This instrument is also 
                    my primary drive for the development of my music theory knowledge.

                <p>
                    In efforts to diversify my music portfolio and expand my theory, I have also developed 
                    proficiencies with guitar. Much like with piano, jazz is my preferred route here, 
                    but I can also spice things up and play in really any band/ gig environment that is 
                    needed of me. I can play really any kind of guitar (although something of a steel
                    guitar might be a challenge!) and style that is needed. This has also given me 
                    a little insight into the world of audio engineering and studio set ups.
