        Hello,

          [about me] 
          My name is Austin Colt and I am a developer by trade and musician by hobby. That's not to say that I am
          more passionate about one or the other, but I do have a particular knack for both.

          [programming] 
          Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by computers and code. I learned how to program at a very young
          age (following in the footsteps of my father) and have been doing fun and exciting things ever since.

          [music] 
          In the grand scheme of things, music has been a more recent adventure for me, but one that I have found to be
          quite fulfilling, and is something that has given me a unique perspective on the problems on life.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        [Overview] 
        I am proficient in many languages in different areas. I am fluent with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm proficient
        in Ruby on the web end. As far as OOP or more general purpose languages go, I am fluent in Python, Java, C# and
        others.

        [Celestial Crops] 
        A fun project designed as a mod for the popular sandbox game, "Terraria". This project gave me experience working
        with large scale APIs, C# projects, and bigger picture OOP design.

        [Odessea]
        A work in progress game that I am developing based on the MonoGame framework. The engine is being designed from
        scratch to support a wide range of different features.

      </ul>
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        [General overview]
        Music has brought profound changes to my life in many different forms. It has allowed me to think about problems
        with a unique perspective, and have given me a greater appreciation for living in the moment

        [Piano] 
        Piano is my primary instrument of choice, and is what I have the most experience with. I can play mostly any genre 
        and I'm great with working on the fly. I've played in jazz bands, and have even gigged with other pop/punk rock
        bands.

        [Guitar] 
        In efforts to diversify my music portfolio and expand my theory, I have also developed proficiencies with guitar.
        Much like with piano, jazz is my preferred route here, but I can also spice things up and play in really any band/ 
        gig environment that is needed of me.
