                    I am proficient in many languages in different areas. I am fluent with HTML, 
                    CSS, JavaScript, and I'm proficient in Ruby on the web end. As far as OOP or 
                    more general purpose languages go, I am fluent in Python, Java, C# and others.
                    I have also delved a little bit into the world of machine learning and I'm 
                    versatile on just about any project you can think of.

                    A fun project designed as a mod for the popular sandbox game, "Terraria". 
                    This project gave me experience working with large scale APIs, C# projects, 
                    and bigger picture OOP design. It was my first big project that I took on and 
                    is still being worked on to this day to maximize content and efficiency.

                    A work in progress game that I am developing based on the MonoGame framework. 
                    The engine is being designed from scratch to support a wide range of different 
                    features. The game will feature many complicated elements including dynamic/moving 
                    scenes and the nested scope of many environments (ex. from character to ship to space)
