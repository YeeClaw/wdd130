        <p>Hello everybody! My name (as you probably could have guessed) is Austin! I am a freshman here at BYUI and I am majoring in computer science.</p>
        <p>I love playing video games although that part of my life is less active than it used to be...more and more now I find myself interesting in other things such as Music and
            climbing!
